# Master's degree final project and thesis

The proposed project for the masterâ€™s thesis was undertaken to create an immersive virtual
environment / virtual world of a historical tourism site wherein any virtual user around the world can completely immerse in the virtual setting and interact with various forms of spatial data within the site without any prior site-specific knowledge.
The project was built using Web Technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The idea has been put into practice using the WebGL engine Babylon.js.
